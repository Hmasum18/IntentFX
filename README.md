# IntentFX
This project is about how to achieve screen changing(multiple scene in a single stage). Intent class help us to achieve this goal.
# How to use:
Constructor:
```java
//here fxmlLocationFromSrc is the location of your fxml file from your src folder
public Intent(Stage stage, String fxmlLocationFromSrc)
public Intent(Scene scene, String fxmlLocationFromSrc)
//node can be anything which extends node. Button and ImageView for example
public Intent(Node node, String fxmlLocationFromSrc) 
```
#### Adding a new stage in your primary stage:
This code snippet add new scene related with the fxml.
startNewScene() method starts a brand-new scene deleting the previous scene if exist.
```java
Intent intent = new Intent(primaryStage,"src\\example\\res\\fxml\\main.fxml");
intent.startNewScene();
primaryStage.show();
```
#### Adding a new stage in a node(button here):
This code snippet add new scene related with the fxml.
startNewScene() method starts a brand-new scene deleting the previous scene if exist.
```java
 mChangeSceneBtn.setOnAction(event -> {
            Intent intent = new Intent(mChangeSceneBtn,"src\\example\\res\\fxml\\second_screen.fxml");
            try {
                intent.startNewScene();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
```
#### Demonstrating startScene() method: 
startScene() method add the old scene to the stage if exist.

In scene doesn't exist creates a new scene and add it to the stage.
```java
 mBackBtn.setOnAction(event -> {
            try {
                Intent intent = new Intent(mBackBtn,"src\\example\\res\\fxml\\main.fxml");
                intent.startScene();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
```
